# Linkding Apps (WIP)

Android(and soon iOS) app for [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) self-hosted
bookmarking service.

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is under heavy development to modularize and migrate to using Compose
> Multiplatform.

## Motivation

Itâ€™s an app that I built for myself to use to quickly bookmark and access them from my
phone. [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding)
The repository is very much a playground to play around with architecture, Gradle, libraries,
patterns, API design, and more.

## Colophon

- Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform.
- [Circuit](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/) for compose powered UI state management.
- [Kotlin Inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject) for DI.
- [Arrow Kt](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject) for functional types.
