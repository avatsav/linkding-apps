# Linkding Apps (WIP)

Android(and soon iOS) app for [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) self-hosted
bookmarking service.

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is under heavy development to modularize and migrate to using Compose
> Multiplatform.

## Motivation

This is an app that I built for myself to add and access bookmarks from my Linkding instance.
It is very much a playground to experiment with architecture, Gradle, libraries, patterns, API design, and more.

## Colophon

- Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform.
- [circuit](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/) for compose powered UI state management.
- [kotlin-inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject) for DI.
- [kotlin-result](https://github.com/michaelbull/kotlin-result) for result types.
