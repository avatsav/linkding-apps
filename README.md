# Linkding Apps (WIP)

Android and iOS app for [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) self-hosted bookmarking service.

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is under heavy development.

## Motivation

I developed this app for personal use, aiming to integrate with my Linkding instance while also serving as a playground for exploring architecture, Gradle, diverse libraries, design patterns, API design, and more.

This project owes it's multiplatform foundation to the excellent [Tivi](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi) project.

## Colophon

- Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform.
- [circuit](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/) for compose powered UI state management.
- [kotlin-inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject) for DI.
- [kotlin-result](https://github.com/michaelbull/kotlin-result) for result types.
- Icons generated with [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen)
